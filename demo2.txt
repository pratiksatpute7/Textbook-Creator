MACHINE LEARNING

 The study of mathematical optimization delivers methods, theory and application domains to the field of machine learning. In supervised learning, the algorithm builds a mathematical model from a set of data that contains both the inputs and the desired outputs. In unsupervised learning, the algorithm builds a mathematical model from a set of data which contains only inputs and no desired output labels. As a scientific endeavor, machine learning grew out of the quest for artificial intelligence. Already in the early days of AI as an academic discipline, some researchers were interested in having machines learn from data. Some statisticians have adopted methods from machine learning, leading to a combined field that they call statistical learning. If the hypothesis is less complex than the function, then the model has underfit the data. If the complexity of the model is increased in response, then the training error decreases. The data is known as training data, and consists of a set of training examples. The algorithms therefore learn from test data that has not been labeled, classified or categorized. In machine learning, the environment is typically represented as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). In supervised feature learning, features are learned using labeled input data. In unsupervised feature learning, features are learned with unlabeled input data. However, real-world data such as images, video, and sensory data has not yielded to attempts to algorithmically define specific features. Performing machine learning involves creating a model, which is trained on some training data and then can process additional data to make predictions. However, over time, attention moved to performing specific tasks, leading to deviations from biology. It is one of the predictive modeling approaches used in statistics, data mining and machine learning. In machine learning, genetic algorithms were used in the 1980s and 1990s. Usually, machine learning models require a lot of data in order for them to perform well. Usually, when training a machine learning model, one needs to collect a large, representative sample of data from a training set. However, these rates are ratios that fail to reveal their numerators and denominators.

CRICKET

 The batting side scores runs by striking the ball bowled at the wicket with the bat, while the bowling and fielding side tries to prevent this and dismiss each player (so they are "out"). When ten players have been dismissed, the innings ends and the teams swap roles. Traditionally cricketers play in all-white kit, but in limited overs cricket they wear club or team colours. In cricket's case, a key difference is the existence of a solid target structure, the wicket (originally, it is thought, a "wicket gate" through which sheep were herded), that the batsman must defend. In Samuel Johnson's Dictionary, he derived cricket from "cryce, Saxon, a stick". Along with prizefighting, horse racing and blood sports, cricket was perceived to be a gambling sport. As it was sure to produce a result, limited overs cricket was lucrative and the number of matches increased. In cricket, the rules of the game are specified in a code called The Laws of Cricket (hereinafter called "the Laws") which has a global remit. During an innings, all eleven members of the fielding team take the field, but usually only two members of the batting team are on the field at any given time. i) A used white ball. The bat is made of wood, usually salix alba (white willow), and has the shape of a blade topped by a cylindrical handle. During matches, the quality of the ball deteriorates to a point where it is no longer usable, and during the course of this deterioration its behaviour in flight will change and can influence the outcome of the match. During normal play, thirteen players and two umpires are on the field. Three members of the fielding team (4, 10 & 11; wearing dark blue) are in shot. Of the eleven fielders, three are in shot in the image above. Depending on their primary skills, the other ten players in the team tend to be classified as specialist batsmen or specialist bowlers. Depending on the type of match being played, each team has either one or two innings. when six balls have been bowled. The batsmen do not change ends at the end of the over, and so the one who was non-striker is now the striker and vice-versa. "); when intervals start and end; and the suitability of the pitch, field and weather for playing the game. curve) in flight. The batsman has to be very wary of such deliveries as they are often "flighted" or spun so that the ball will not behave quite as he expects and he could be "trapped" into getting himself out. "; otherwise, he will shake his head and say "Not out". The batsman does not have to play a shot and can allow the ball to go through to the wicketkeeper. Equally, he does not have to attempt a run when he hits the ball with his bat. The batsman on strike (i.e. Limited overs cricket is always scheduled for completion in a single day. In 1969, a national league competition was established. Limited overs matches cannot be drawn, although a tie is possible and an unfinished match is a "no result". In Australia, the first-class teams represent the various states. It originated as a term for difficult batting conditions in cricket, caused by a damp and soft pitch. Francis Bacon, an avid cricket fan, captured a batsman in motion.


VIRAT KOHLI

 His father, Prem Kohli, worked as a criminal lawyer and his mother, Saroj Kohli, is a housewife. He just wouldn’t leave." There were tough times for the family... It's all embedded in my memory." I miss his presence sometimes." He took every match seriously. Now, he looked like he was chasing his father's dream which was his own too." He had scores of 37, 25 and 31 in the other three matches. India won the series 3–2 which was India's first ODI series win against Sri Lanka in Sri Lanka. Some of the shots he played spoke about his ability." India won by seven wickets to seal the series 3–1. The man of the match was awarded to Gambhir who gave the award to Kohli. India went on to win the Test series 1–0 but Kohli amassed just 76 runs from five innings, struggling against the short ball and was particularly troubled by the fast bowling of Edwards, who dismissed him three times in the series. India won the subsequent ODI series 4–1 in which Kohli managed to accumulate 243 runs at 60.75. India won the series 4–1 and on account of scoring the most runs in the series, Kohli was named player of the series. India won the two-match series 2–0, and Kohli averaged 106 with one hundred and two fifties from three innings. India went on to secure a five-run win and their second consecutive ICC ODI tournament victory. India lost the match by one wicket, and Dhoni was subsequently ruled out of the series with Kohli being named the captain for the remaining matches. India lost the match by two wickets, but took the series 2–1 after winning the last match at Kanpur. India were knocked out of the tournament after narrow losses against Sri Lanka and Pakistan, in which Kohli scored 48 and 5 respectively. Every time Kohli came in, all he did was bowl at off stump, around the corridor of uncertainty and Kohli nicked it. India won the ODI series that followed 3–1, but Kohli's struggles with the bat continued with an average of 18 in four innings. India lost the match by three runs, but Kohli reached the number one spot for T20I batsmen in the ICC rankings. India went on to post 307 in 50 overs and register a 130-run victory in the match. India went on to secure wins in these four fixtures and top the Pool B points with an undefeated record. India was eliminated in the semi-final by Australia at Melbourne, where Kohli was dismissed for 1 off 13 balls, top-edging a short-pitched delivery from Mitchell Johnson. India lost the series after a defeat in the final ODI and Kohli finished the series with an average of 49. India went on to wrap the series 2–0 and briefly top the ICC Test Rankings before being displaced by Pakistan at the position. India won the ODI series 5–1, Kohli becoming the first Indian captain to win an ODI series in South Africa. On 2 August, Kohli scored his first Test century on English soil in the first test match of the series against England. On 5 August, Kohli displaced Steve Smith to become the No. He had scored 82 in the third test at MCG, in which India won. Overall. India lost the semi-final against New Zealand, in which Kohli was out for just a run. He had an indifferent 2008 season, with a total of 165 runs in 12 innings at an average of 15.00 and a strike rate of 105.09. He added, "It's a business venture for me for the future. He had that spark.

MACHINE LEARNING

 The study of mathematical optimization delivers methods, theory and application domains to the field of machine learning. In supervised learning, the algorithm builds a mathematical model from a set of data that contains both the inputs and the desired outputs. In unsupervised learning, the algorithm builds a mathematical model from a set of data which contains only inputs and no desired output labels. As a scientific endeavor, machine learning grew out of the quest for artificial intelligence. Already in the early days of AI as an academic discipline, some researchers were interested in having machines learn from data. Some statisticians have adopted methods from machine learning, leading to a combined field that they call statistical learning. If the hypothesis is less complex than the function, then the model has underfit the data. If the complexity of the model is increased in response, then the training error decreases. The data is known as training data, and consists of a set of training examples. The algorithms therefore learn from test data that has not been labeled, classified or categorized. In machine learning, the environment is typically represented as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). In supervised feature learning, features are learned using labeled input data. In unsupervised feature learning, features are learned with unlabeled input data. However, real-world data such as images, video, and sensory data has not yielded to attempts to algorithmically define specific features. Performing machine learning involves creating a model, which is trained on some training data and then can process additional data to make predictions. However, over time, attention moved to performing specific tasks, leading to deviations from biology. It is one of the predictive modeling approaches used in statistics, data mining and machine learning. In machine learning, genetic algorithms were used in the 1980s and 1990s. Usually, machine learning models require a lot of data in order for them to perform well. Usually, when training a machine learning model, one needs to collect a large, representative sample of data from a training set. However, these rates are ratios that fail to reveal their numerators and denominators.

CRICKET

 The batting side scores runs by striking the ball bowled at the wicket with the bat, while the bowling and fielding side tries to prevent this and dismiss each player (so they are "out"). When ten players have been dismissed, the innings ends and the teams swap roles. Traditionally cricketers play in all-white kit, but in limited overs cricket they wear club or team colours. In cricket's case, a key difference is the existence of a solid target structure, the wicket (originally, it is thought, a "wicket gate" through which sheep were herded), that the batsman must defend. In Samuel Johnson's Dictionary, he derived cricket from "cryce, Saxon, a stick". Along with prizefighting, horse racing and blood sports, cricket was perceived to be a gambling sport. As it was sure to produce a result, limited overs cricket was lucrative and the number of matches increased. In cricket, the rules of the game are specified in a code called The Laws of Cricket (hereinafter called "the Laws") which has a global remit. During an innings, all eleven members of the fielding team take the field, but usually only two members of the batting team are on the field at any given time. i) A used white ball. The bat is made of wood, usually salix alba (white willow), and has the shape of a blade topped by a cylindrical handle. During matches, the quality of the ball deteriorates to a point where it is no longer usable, and during the course of this deterioration its behaviour in flight will change and can influence the outcome of the match. During normal play, thirteen players and two umpires are on the field. Three members of the fielding team (4, 10 & 11; wearing dark blue) are in shot. Of the eleven fielders, three are in shot in the image above. Depending on their primary skills, the other ten players in the team tend to be classified as specialist batsmen or specialist bowlers.

MACHINE LEARNING

 The study of mathematical optimization delivers methods, theory and application domains to the field of machine learning. In supervised learning, the algorithm builds a mathematical model from a set of data that contains both the inputs and the desired outputs. In unsupervised learning, the algorithm builds a mathematical model from a set of data which contains only inputs and no desired output labels. As a scientific endeavor, machine learning grew out of the quest for artificial intelligence. Already in the early days of AI as an academic discipline, some researchers were interested in having machines learn from data. Some statisticians have adopted methods from machine learning, leading to a combined field that they call statistical learning. If the hypothesis is less complex than the function, then the model has underfit the data. If the complexity of the model is increased in response, then the training error decreases. The data is known as training data, and consists of a set of training examples. The algorithms therefore learn from test data that has not been labeled, classified or categorized. In machine learning, the environment is typically represented as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). In supervised feature learning, features are learned using labeled input data. In unsupervised feature learning, features are learned with unlabeled input data. However, real-world data such as images, video, and sensory data has not yielded to attempts to algorithmically define specific features. Performing machine learning involves creating a model, which is trained on some training data and then can process additional data to make predictions. However, over time, attention moved to performing specific tasks, leading to deviations from biology. It is one of the predictive modeling approaches used in statistics, data mining and machine learning. In machine learning, genetic algorithms were used in the 1980s and 1990s. Usually, machine learning models require a lot of data in order for them to perform well. Usually, when training a machine learning model, one needs to collect a large, representative sample of data from a training set. However, these rates are ratios that fail to reveal their numerators and denominators.

MAHENDRA SINGH DHONI

 Dhoni has been the recipient of many awards, including the ICC ODI Player of the Year award in 2008 and 2009 (the first player to win the award twice), the Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna award in 2007, the Padma Shri, India's fourth highest civilian honour, in 2009 and the Padma Bhushan, India's third highest civilian honour, in 2018. Dhoni holds the post of Vice-President of India Cements Ltd., after resigning from Air India. Dhoni: The Untold Story was made about him. Dhoni has a sister Jayanti Gupta and a brother Narendra Singh Dhoni. His colleagues remember him as a very honest, straightforward employee of the Indian Railways. Dhoni has credited Deval Sahay for instilling discipline in him . Dhoni did not have a great start to his ODI career, getting run out for a duck on debut. In spite of an average series against Bangladesh, Dhoni was picked for the Pakistan ODI series. Dhoni had few batting opportunities in the first two games of the Sri Lankan bilateral ODI series (October–November 2005) and was promoted to No. However, the team finished poorly scoring just 43 runs in the last eight overs and lost the match due to Duckworth-Lewis method. Dhoni had a good Afro-Asia Cup, scoring 174 runs in 3 matches at an average of 87.00, with a blitzkrieg 139 not out off 97 balls, a Man of the Match innings, in the third ODI. Dhoni had an excellent year in ODIs in 2009, scoring 1198 runs in just 24 innings, at an astonishing average of 70.43. However, his field placements and tactics came handy, the team was successful beating the opposition by five runs (D/L method). Meanwhile, he scored his 8000th run in ODI cricket on the tour. Dhoni had a good performance with the bat scoring a half century in each of the series. Dhoni himself managed just 70 runs from three innings averaging 23.34. The century, his tenth in ODIs, was his first in over three years. However, he was included in the squad named for the ODI series there. Following his good one-day performance against Sri Lanka, Dhoni replaced Dinesh Karthik in December 2005 as the Indian teams' Test wicket-keeper. However, Dhoni and the Indian fielders dropped catches and missed many dismissal chances, including a key stumping opportunity of Andrew Flintoff (14). Following the third Test in Melbourne, Dhoni announced his retirement from the format. Dhoni had previously captained India on a stand-in basis against South Africa and Australia, in 2008 and 2009 respectively. It was under his captaincy that India climbed to No. Dhoni has captained India in two World Cups. Thus, India was out of the world cup in the very first round. Under Dhoni's captaincy, India won the 2011 World Cup. However, they lost to host Australia in the semi-finals held at the Sydney Cricket Ground. However, his team finished in 7th place. A biographical film based on the life of Dhoni, titled M.S. Dhoni: The Untold Story, was released on 30 September 2016. Dhoni: The Untold Story.


MACHINE LEARNING

 The study of mathematical optimization delivers methods, theory and application domains to the field of machine learning. In supervised learning, the algorithm builds a mathematical model from a set of data that contains both the inputs and the desired outputs. In unsupervised learning, the algorithm builds a mathematical model from a set of data which contains only inputs and no desired output labels. As a scientific endeavor, machine learning grew out of the quest for artificial intelligence. Already in the early days of AI as an academic discipline, some researchers were interested in having machines learn from data. Some statisticians have adopted methods from machine learning, leading to a combined field that they call statistical learning. If the hypothesis is less complex than the function, then the model has underfit the data. If the complexity of the model is increased in response, then the training error decreases. The data is known as training data, and consists of a set of training examples. The algorithms therefore learn from test data that has not been labeled, classified or categorized. In machine learning, the environment is typically represented as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). In supervised feature learning, features are learned using labeled input data. In unsupervised feature learning, features are learned with unlabeled input data. However, real-world data such as images, video, and sensory data has not yielded to attempts to algorithmically define specific features. Performing machine learning involves creating a model, which is trained on some training data and then can process additional data to make predictions. However, over time, attention moved to performing specific tasks, leading to deviations from biology. It is one of the predictive modeling approaches used in statistics, data mining and machine learning. In machine learning, genetic algorithms were used in the 1980s and 1990s. Usually, machine learning models require a lot of data in order for them to perform well. Usually, when training a machine learning model, one needs to collect a large, representative sample of data from a training set. However, these rates are ratios that fail to reveal their numerators and denominators.

 Dhoni has been the recipient of many awards, including the ICC ODI Player of the Year award in 2008 and 2009 (the first player to win the award twice), the Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna award in 2007, the Padma Shri, India's fourth highest civilian honour, in 2009 and the Padma Bhushan, India's third highest civilian honour, in 2018. Dhoni holds the post of Vice-President of India Cements Ltd., after resigning from Air India. Dhoni: The Untold Story was made about him. Dhoni has a sister Jayanti Gupta and a brother Narendra Singh Dhoni. His colleagues remember him as a very honest, straightforward employee of the Indian Railways. Dhoni has credited Deval Sahay for instilling discipline in him . Dhoni did not have a great start to his ODI career, getting run out for a duck on debut. In spite of an average series against Bangladesh, Dhoni was picked for the Pakistan ODI series. Dhoni had few batting opportunities in the first two games of the Sri Lankan bilateral ODI series (October–November 2005) and was promoted to No. However, the team finished poorly scoring just 43 runs in the last eight overs and lost the match due to Duckworth-Lewis method. Dhoni had a good Afro-Asia Cup, scoring 174 runs in 3 matches at an average of 87.00, with a blitzkrieg 139 not out off 97 balls, a Man of the Match innings, in the third ODI. Dhoni had an excellent year in ODIs in 2009, scoring 1198 runs in just 24 innings, at an astonishing average of 70.43. However, his field placements and tactics came handy, the team was successful beating the opposition by five runs (D/L method). Meanwhile, he scored his 8000th run in ODI cricket on the tour. Dhoni had a good performance with the bat scoring a half century in each of the series. Dhoni himself managed just 70 runs from three innings averaging 23.34. The century, his tenth in ODIs, was his first in over three years. However, he was included in the squad named for the ODI series there. Following his good one-day performance against Sri Lanka, Dhoni replaced Dinesh Karthik in December 2005 as the Indian teams' Test wicket-keeper. However, Dhoni and the Indian fielders dropped catches and missed many dismissal chances, including a key stumping opportunity of Andrew Flintoff (14). Following the third Test in Melbourne, Dhoni announced his retirement from the format. Dhoni had previously captained India on a stand-in basis against South Africa and Australia, in 2008 and 2009 respectively. It was under his captaincy that India climbed to No. Dhoni has captained India in two World Cups. Thus, India was out of the world cup in the very first round. Under Dhoni's captaincy, India won the 2011 World Cup. However, they lost to host Australia in the semi-finals held at the Sydney Cricket Ground. However, his team finished in 7th place. A biographical film based on the life of Dhoni, titled M.S. Dhoni: The Untold Story, was released on 30 September 2016. Dhoni: The Untold Story.

MACHINE LEARNING

 The study of mathematical optimization delivers methods, theory and application domains to the field of machine learning. In supervised learning, the algorithm builds a mathematical model from a set of data that contains both the inputs and the desired outputs. In unsupervised learning, the algorithm builds a mathematical model from a set of data which contains only inputs and no desired output labels. As a scientific endeavor, machine learning grew out of the quest for artificial intelligence. Already in the early days of AI as an academic discipline, some researchers were interested in having machines learn from data. Some statisticians have adopted methods from machine learning, leading to a combined field that they call statistical learning. If the hypothesis is less complex than the function, then the model has underfit the data. If the complexity of the model is increased in response, then the training error decreases. The data is known as training data, and consists of a set of training examples. The algorithms therefore learn from test data that has not been labeled, classified or categorized. In machine learning, the environment is typically represented as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). In supervised feature learning, features are learned using labeled input data. In unsupervised feature learning, features are learned with unlabeled input data. However, real-world data such as images, video, and sensory data has not yielded to attempts to algorithmically define specific features. Performing machine learning involves creating a model, which is trained on some training data and then can process additional data to make predictions. However, over time, attention moved to performing specific tasks, leading to deviations from biology. It is one of the predictive modeling approaches used in statistics, data mining and machine learning. In machine learning, genetic algorithms were used in the 1980s and 1990s. Usually, machine learning models require a lot of data in order for them to perform well. Usually, when training a machine learning model, one needs to collect a large, representative sample of data from a training set. However, these rates are ratios that fail to reveal their numerators and denominators.

RAHUL DRAVID

 Dravid holds a unique record of never getting out for a Golden duck in the 286 Test innings which he has played. Dravid has also been honoured with the Padma Shri and the Padma Bhushan award, India's fourth and third highest civilian awards respectively. Dravid was born in a Marathi Deshastha Brahmin family in Indore, Madhya Pradesh. His family later moved to Bangalore, Karnataka, where he was raised. Dravid has a younger brother named Vijay. Dravid started playing cricket at the age of 12, and represented Karnataka at the under-15, the under-17 and the under-19 levels. Dravid scored a century for his school team. Dravid made his Ranji Trophy debut in February 1991, while still attending college. Dravid eventually made his international debut on 3 April 1996 in an ODI against Sri Lanka in the Singer Cup held in Singapore immediately after the 1996 World Cup, replacing Vinod Kambli. In contrast to his ODI debut, his Test debut was rather successful one. Dravid was selected for the Indian squad touring England on the backdrop of a consistent performance in domestic cricket for five years. Dravid had already been informed that he would play if Manjrekar fails the test. His face lit up. Dravid scored 95 runs before getting out to the bowling of Chris Lewis. Dravid concluded a successful debut series with an impressive average of 62.33 from two Test matches. Batting at no. 6, he scored 40 runs in the first innings. Dravid batted at no. Dravid continued in the same vein in the West Indies where he once again top scored for India in the five–match Test series aggregating 360 runs at an average of 72.00 including four fifties. Dravid continued his good run scoring seven fifties in the next eight Tests that included fifties in six consecutive innings (three each against Sri Lanka and Australia), becoming only the second Indian to do so after Gundappa Vishwanath. Dravid top scored in both the innings against Zimbabwe scoring 118 and 44 runs respectively however, India lost the one-off Test. Dravid topped the runs table for the series with 321 runs from two matches at an average of 107.00 but could not prevent India from losing the series 0–1. Later that month, India played a two Test home series against Pakistan. Dravid didn't contribute much with the bat. India lost the First Test but won the Second Test in Delhi riding on Kumble's historic 10-wicket haul. Dravid played his part in the 10-wicket haul by taking a catch to dismiss Mushtaq Ahmed who was Kumble's eighth victim of the innings. Dravid couldn't do much with the bat as India went on to lose the riot-affected First Test of the championship against Pakistan at the Eden Gardens.
